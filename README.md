# STAT447
Final project for STAT447 (Bayesian Statistics)

Python script "STAT447Final_Project.py" generates the trials of mcmc methods, 10 trials at each dimension value. Automatically calculates confidence interval bounds for each value and saves means + bounds to a .pkl file. \\
Python script "generate_plots.py" generates 2 matplotlib images, visualizing each method individually and a comparison between the three.
